# ECSE316_A2

python3 was used for this Assignment

To call fft.py, use the calling syntax python3 fft.py -m (whatever mode you want) -i (whatever image you want)

Please keep in mind part 4 takes longer than 11 minutes to execute

Furthermore, if you wish to check the plots for 1D, please uncomment the code for 1D and comment the code for 2D. I did this again for time concerns
